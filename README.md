# README Generartor

## Description

I built this project to help develope my backend javascript skills. It implemented many of the things that I've recently learned in the course including string literals, inquirer, and writing files with node. It can also quickly generate README.md for me in the future

## Installation

Inquerir must be installed to operate the app. (Could you please leave in the comments if I need to include jest. Since it doesn't take an active part in the app and only testing it wouldn't belong here correct?)

## Usage

When the file is ran, it will generate a series of prompts. It will then use this information and insert it into the appropriate sections of a professional-style README. It will also post a badge at the top of the that will direct the reader to more licensing information.
